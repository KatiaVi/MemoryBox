# MemoryBox

The memory box is an empathetic environment where you share a memory and then get to experience the memories with the same emotion of past visitors.

The aim behind the project was to give a user a private space where they can share an experience or memory that they feel strongly about and then see how others have experienced the same emotion in the past.

For example, if one shares a sad memory, the memory box will play back similar memories. The idea is to have "strangers" empathize with the user and show them that they are not alone in their sadness or how others have dealt with similar experiences.
